# My DSA Projects
This repo contain the following projects:
1. Class Exercises 
   1. Euclid GCD
   2. Sieve of Erathosthenes
   3. Finding the Largest Number in an array

2. Searching & Sorting Algorithms 
3. Semester Project - Transportation Problem


<h2>Documentation - Semester Project</h2>
**Description:**<br />
_This project uses two different algorithms to calculate the shortest path between two locations._

**Details:**<br />
The study case location was the University of Ghana campus. 
We chose 24 different locations on the campus.

**Algorithms Used**
1. Critical Path Method - For calculating shortest distance between locations
2. Vogel Approximation Method - For finding time of arrivals

**How it Works**<br />
1. User is given a long list of location to choose a source and destination using the indexes
2. The applications calculate the shortest distances and the time of arrivals.
